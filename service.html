			<p class="service__text">
				As a college student majoring in engineering, I possess a unique skill set that can be 
				harnessed to serve my community in several ways. For me, it starts with my family&mdash;they
				are the ones who have given the most to me, so I try to give back to them whenever I can.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				When it comes to my younger siblings, I offer educational support whenever they 
				need it by helping with homework, introducing difficult concepts in interesting 
				ways, and inspiring curiosity. My goal is to help them be driven to learn new things 
				and to grow into intelligent and well-rounded people.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				To serve my parents, I try to be first of all a good son, which means respecting 
				their wisdom, taking their advice, and being a good role model for my siblings. 
				I offer some of the money that I earn from my job to my mom so that she can pay 
				for improvements to the home, or put extra money towards my siblings' education. 
				I also perform small acts of service when I'm at the house, like helping out with 
				physical labor or fixing things that are broken.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				Within the college environment, I serve my classmates by trying to foster an 
				atmosphere where people know that they can share their ideas freely. Inviting 
				others to study sessions, sharing project insights, and providing assistance 
				with difficult engineering problems contribute to a supportive academic community, 
				creating an environment where everyone can thrive.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				Finally, I give back to the community as a whole by engaging in outreach programs 
				and volunteering at various local organizations, such as the 
				<a href="https://aggielandhumane.org/" class="service__text--link">Aggieland Humane Society</a>.
				I also leverage my engineering expertise to address local challenges, like helping 
				neighbors and family friends fix things. And sometimes, I serve others by just saying 
				“yes” when they ask for a favor. By using my skills to serve others, I not only improve 
				my own life but play an important role in advancing the well-being of the community as a whole.

			<h2 class="service__header service--blue">Areas of Improvement</h2>
			<p class="service__text">
				Although I belive that one of the best ways to support your community is to support
				yourself first, I will be the first to admit that there is much more I could do 
				to support my community.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				In the future, I want to engage more with volunteering efforts, especially in areas
				where my engineering skills can be of use. I'm also going to make an effort to connect
				with more community STEM engagement events, where I can share my passion for engineering,
				help get kids more invested in education, and influence the community in a positive way.
			</p>
			<p class="service__text">
				Finally, I hope that once I graduate, I'll be able to support my community by contributing
				my skills and career experience, as well as donate to local organizations using my 
				newly-acquired wealth.
