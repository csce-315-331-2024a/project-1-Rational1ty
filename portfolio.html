				<h2 class="portfolio__title">Pseudo-3D Game Engine</h2>
				<p class="portfolio__text">
					A pseudo-3D (also known as 2.5D) game engine created with Java that uses a technique called 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting#Ray_casting_in_early_computer_games" class="portfolio__text--link">ray casting</a>
					to make the game appear 3D while the underlying logic is 2D. This 
					technique was used for many of the earliest "3D" games, such as 
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D" class="portfolio__text--link">Wolfenstein 3D</a>.
					Since the engine only works in 2D, these types of games can run on 
					much weaker devices than modern 3D games, especially those without a GPU. 
				</p>
				<p class="portfolio__text">
					I really enjoy playing around with this project since I can add whatever 
					textures, sprites, sounds, and NPCs that I want. In the future, I'd like to 
					use this engine to make an actual game similar in style to early games like
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)" class="portfolio__text--link">Doom</a>.

				<h2 class="portfolio__title">Nearest Plane App</h2>
				<p class="portfolio__text">
					This is a simple yet interesting web app that uses the powerful
					<a href="https://openskynetwork.github.io/opensky-api/" class="portfolio__text--link">OpenSky API</a>
					to collect and process all sorts of interesting data about aircraft. It can tell
					you the closest plane to your current location, or any location in the world. It
					also shows you tons of cool data about each of the planes it detects, along with each
					flight's callsign and airline.

				<h2 class="portfolio__title">Conway's Game of Life</h2>
				<p class="portfolio__text">
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" class="portfolio__text--link">Conway's game of life</a> 
					is one of my favorite games to create in any programming language. This is a 
					simple implementation written in Java, but it has several nice features that
					make it easy to experiment with new patterns and designs. It's a great way to
					waste time&mdash;&mdash;just start the game and become mesmerized by all the spirals,
					flowers, gliders, and other cool visuals!
